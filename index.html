      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>In May 2021, I decided to transition my career to tech.</p>
      <p>I document my journey of becoming a full stack web developer.</p>
      <p>The ultimate dream is freedom of time and financial independence.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, follow me on the social medias to keep track of my progress.</p>
      <p>Wish me luck!</p>

      <h2>The journey and my learnings.</h2>
      <p>As a millenial having no prior experience in coding, I write about my experience of learning to code in my 30s.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, the biggest obstacle that I faced (and still face, although less frequently) was my own self-doubt and my mental block towards learning to program.</p>
      <p>"Can you break into tech in your 30s?"</p>
      <p>"Is a career change even possible at this age?"</p>
      <p>"Would I be able to learn to code?"</p>
      <p>"Do I need to be a genius to do this?"</p>
      <p>"Is it too late??!"</p>
      <p>These were some of the nagging doubts that kept me from progressing in the early months of learning to code.</p>
      <p>Now 12 months into my learning journey, I write about what I discovered about myself while pursuing my goals.</p>
      <p>If you are reading this, you are most likely pursuing a similar path, and I hope that sharing my thoughts will help you in your journey as well.</p>
      <p>Best of luck!</p>
